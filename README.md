# Bash-aliases

Here you can find any short of bash script you like.  
This is an initial thought of creating bash aliases and call them from here with:  
```
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h1dd3n3y3/Bash-aliases/main/script_name.sh
```
You may, of course, change the `script_name.sh` according to your script preference.
